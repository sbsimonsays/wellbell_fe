## Overview

Our WellBell App is for anyone Working From Home with long hours on the computer. Users set Bell reminders based on their preference of Physical, Nutritional and Mental/Self-Care. These Bells build better work habits over time, leading to a healthier, happier user and creating an optimal work life balance!
According to the American Psychiatric Association, the majority of employees working from home have reported experiencing negative mental health impacts. WellBell is here to step in and help you take care of you with daily physical, nutritional and self care reminders!
